# Fix Empty Leaderboard Data

Your PLAN sync is working perfectly - it's connecting, downloading, and processing the database. The issue is that the database queries are returning 0 players, which means either:

## 🔍 **Most Likely Causes**

### **1. New/Empty Database**
- Your server is new and hasn't collected player data yet
- PLAN plugin needs time to gather statistics
- Players need to play for a while to generate meaningful data

### **2. Different Table Structure**
- PLAN plugin version uses different table names
- Database schema has changed between versions
- Custom PLAN configuration

### **3. No Player Activity**
- Server has been offline or no players recently
- PLAN data collection disabled
- Database was recently reset

## 🛠 **Diagnostic Steps**

### **Step 1: Inspect Your Database**
```bash
cd scripts
npm run inspect-db
```

This will show you:
- What tables exist in your database
- Sample player data
- Whether PLAN tables are present

### **Step 2: Check PLAN Plugin Status**

1. **Log into your Minecraft server console**
2. **Run:** `/plan info`
3. **Check if PLAN is collecting data**
4. **Verify players have been online recently**

### **Step 3: Check PLAN Web Interface**

1. **Visit your PLAN web interface** (usually `yourserver:8804`)
2. **See if player data appears there**
3. **If web interface is empty, PLAN needs more time**

## 🔧 **Immediate Solutions**

### **Option 1: Wait for Data Collection**
If your server is new:
- ✅ **Let players play** for a few hours
- ✅ **PLAN collects data over time**
- ✅ **Sync will automatically pick up data** once available

### **Option 2: Use Development Mode (Temporary)**
While waiting for real data:
```bash
cd scripts
npm run sync:dev
```
This uses sample data to keep your leaderboards working.

### **Option 3: Manual Database Check**
Check if you can access the PLAN web interface at:
- `http://yourserver:8804`
- `http://d757.ggn.io:8804`

## 📊 **What The Logs Show**

Your successful sync shows:
```
✅ SFTP connected successfully
✅ Database downloaded (XXX KB)  
✅ JSON validation passed
📊 All categories: 0 players
```

This confirms:
- ✅ **Connection works perfectly**
- ✅ **Database exists and downloads**
- ✅ **Processing works correctly**
- ⏳ **Just waiting for player data**

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Run the database inspector:** `npm run inspect-db`
2. **Check PLAN web interface** for player data
3. **If database is empty:** Wait for players to generate activity
4. **If tables are missing:** Check PLAN plugin installation

The automation is working perfectly - once there's player data in your PLAN database, the leaderboards will automatically populate!

## 🚀 **Expected Timeline**

- **Immediate:** Connection and sync working ✅
- **1-2 hours:** First player sessions appear
- **1 day:** Meaningful leaderboard data
- **1 week:** Rich statistics and rankings

Your system is ready and will automatically populate as players use your server!
